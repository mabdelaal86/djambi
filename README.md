**Djambi** is a chess variant for four players designed by *Jean Anesto* in 1975.
As in chess, pieces represent real-life political roles, but in contrast,
they are inspired by modern societies instead of medieval ones.
The game pieces symbolize common sins in modern politics.
For more details, check the [game page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Djambi) on Wikipedia.
